This is an ai chatbot i have developed in Jenuary 2020 it use some pre built sentences and you can answer yes or no and get a reply
from the Apple ii that can be different by the previous choosen yes or no. This is born before my TINA Apple II chatbot.
code:

10 J = INT (6 * RND(1))+1
20 IF J = 1 THEN PRINT "ARE YOU OK":INPUT F$:GOTO 80
30 IF J = 2 THEN PRINT "DO YOU LIVE IN GERMANY": INPUT F$:GOTO 80
40 IF J = 3 THEN PRINT "DO YOU LIKE FOOTBALL": INPUT F$:GOTO 80
50 IF J = 4 THEN PRINT "DO YOU WANT A DRINK": INPUT F$:GOTO 80
60 IF J = 5 THEN PRINT "DO YOU WANT A SNAK": INPUT F$:GOTO 80
70 IF J = 6 THEN PRINT "ARE YOU TIRED": INPUT F$:GOTO 80
80 IF F$ = "YES" THEN PRINT "OK"
90 IF F$ <> "YES" THEN PRINT "OH NOOOO!"
100 GOTO 10 :CLEAR

copy paste the code in your apple ii emulatora and write RUN and press RETURN to give it a try.
